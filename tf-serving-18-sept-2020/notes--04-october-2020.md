`pip install -Uq grpcio==1.26.0`

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'keras' from 'tensorflow' (unknown location)

`pip install tensorflow --upgrade`
output:
```
    Found existing installation: tensorflow 2.3.0

```

If it shows 3.7.0, then tensorflow won't work since python 3.7 doesn't support tensorflow as of now.

WORKS
https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/blob/master/tensorflow_serving/g3doc/docker.md
THIS IS THE SOLUTION ^

`ModelServer` = ?

https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/serving/rest_simple
(But neesd keras)

What does it mean:
    "This will pull the latest TensorFlow Serving image with ModelServer installed."


outcome: these twp pages.
You need to know:
1. ho wo instalal keras (including python version)
2. What is the `ModelServer` claass in tf



Good search: install ModelServer
